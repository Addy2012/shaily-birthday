            Potato chips, a variation on the french fry, were created by George
            Crum, who, in 1853, was working as a chef at a resort in Saratoga
            Springs, NY. While being served his potato fries, one patron
            complained that the slices were too thick. To spite him, Crum
            created paper-thin and very crispy potato slices that were
            impossible to eat with a fork, as was the proper etiquette at the
            time. The plan backfired when the customer was delighted with the
            crisp chips, and the Saratoga Chip was born. Those Saratoga Chips
            have become today's potato chips.

            Happy Birthday to the girl whom I met accidentally. The girl who
            increase my belief on the fact that unexpected things are the
            decision of god and god can't do anything wrong. Have a bright
            future ahead.
